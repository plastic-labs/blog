We're a research and development group working at the intersection of human and machine learning.  

Most recently, we built [Bloom](https://bloombot.ai) -- a reading and writing tutor.  

On this journey we realized that AI tools need a framework for securely and privately handling the intimate data required to unlock deeply personalized, autonomous agents. Itâ€™s our mission to realize this future.
