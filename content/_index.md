Welcome to our collaborative second brain. 

Here you'll find our blog posts, ["Extrusions" newsletter](https://plasticlabs.typeform.com/extrusions), [Honcho release notes](https://plasticlabs.typeform.com/honchoupdates), evergreen notes, and public research. And if you like, [you can engage with the ideas directly](https://github.com/plastic-labs/blog) on GitHub.

Plastic Labs is a research-driven company working at the intersection of human and machine learning. Our current project is [Honcho](https://honcho.dev), a user context management solution for AI-powered applications. 

We believe that by re-centering LLM app development around the user we can unlock a rich landscape of deeply personalized, autonomous agents.

It’s our mission to realize this future.
